# Project-1

# About The Game:
This game was created with JS , HTML and CSS  using the library Phaser 3 to handle the physics required for the purpose of the game and also because it has a lot of features that improve the quality of the game. To add Phaser to this project I had to add the library downloaded from https://phaser.io/download to the directory node_modules that is in this project.


# General description of the Game :
The main purpose is to go up  using the platforms and the clouds to get a key an open a chest . While you are climbing you have to avoid the enemies because if you collide with them you will lose. Also you have to collect the gems t, every gem gives you 100 points.

# How to play it:

Put your pointer in the Start icon
![Menu Game](../IMG/Menu.png)

The you can move the character to the left (left keyboard), to the right (right keyboard) or jump (up keyboard)
![Game Scene](../IMG/Game.png)

Every time that you collide with an enemy you will lose an so the next scene will appear
![Lose Scene](../IMG/Lose.png)

If you make it to the top and you got the key you will win an the next scene will show up
![Win Scene](../IMG/Win.png)

When you lose or win you will be able to play again or go to the menu.


# Conclusion
Using a library was not as easy as I thought it would be, but the Phaser lab was definitively a tool that help a lot. I have never use a library before and I think its a necessary experience before you start to work because a lot of companies have their own libraries and when you are already worked whit that Im pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem doing it in the future
